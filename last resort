first install Ubuntu in proot-distro install Desktop environment starte it up install a VNC server client recommended is tight VNC start up tight VNC join using a VNC viewer stop VNC and exit Ubuntu in termux install debian now don't login in download the source code from the mega link after to doing that using the file manager in the Ubuntu proot-distro you travel to /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/var/lib/proot-distro/installed-rootfs
using a file manager in the Desktop environment you downloaded now extract the source file to a folder now in the original debian go into a folder and in that folder if there is another folder go and that folder repeat until there is no folder in the folder you are in now go in the exact same folder in the modified one now doing this for everything this should replace everything to be Mac OS you can check it by going in the debian proot-distro and starting VNC server and also joining it if something doesn't work then you probably copy the files wrong
